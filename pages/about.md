**Portuguese Slave Marriage Records Collection**  
This digital collection presents historical manuscripts documenting slave marriages in 17th century Portugal. These ecclesiastical records, preserved in the Torre do Tombo National Archive, provide crucial insights into the social and legal frameworks surrounding slavery in early modern Portuguese society.

**Historical Context**  
During the 17th century, Portugal was a major colonial power with extensive slave trading networks. The marriage records preserved in this collection document the legal and social status of enslaved individuals, revealing complex relationships between ecclesiastical authority, colonial administration, and individual agency.

**Collection Scope**  
The collection consists of manuscript fragments from ecclesiastical records, specifically documenting slave marriages. These documents are organized into distinct collection groups (PT-TT-CEL-002-544-1 and PT-TT-CEL-002-544-5), each representing different archival fragments from the same period.

**Research Value**  
These records are invaluable for understanding:

- The legal status of enslaved individuals in Portuguese society
- Ecclesiastical involvement in colonial administration
- Social dynamics and family structures among enslaved populations
- Historical handwriting and bureaucratic practices of the period
