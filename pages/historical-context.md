# Historical Context: Slavery in 17th Century Portugal

## Portuguese Colonial Empire

During the 17th century, Portugal maintained one of the world's most extensive colonial empires, with territories spanning Africa, Asia, and the Americas. This period was marked by the continuation of the Portuguese slave trade, which had begun in the 15th century and would continue well into the 19th century.

## Ecclesiastical Administration

The Catholic Church played a crucial role in colonial administration, particularly in recording and legitimizing various social and legal relationships. Marriage records, such as those in this collection, were maintained by ecclesiastical authorities and served both religious and civil functions.

## Legal Framework

The legal status of enslaved individuals in Portuguese colonial society was complex, involving:

- **Ecclesiastical Law**: The Church's recognition of marriages among enslaved persons
- **Civil Administration**: Colonial bureaucratic practices
- **Social Hierarchies**: The intersection of race, class, and legal status

## Research Significance

These marriage records provide invaluable insights into:

1. **Family Formation**: How enslaved individuals formed and maintained family relationships
2. **Legal Recognition**: The extent to which ecclesiastical authority recognized slave marriages
3. **Social Dynamics**: The complex relationships between religious authority, colonial administration, and individual agency
4. **Historical Documentation**: The systematic recording practices of the period

## Collection Context

The documents in this collection represent fragments from larger ecclesiastical records maintained in Lisbon during the 17th century. They document marriages among enslaved individuals, revealing the intersection of religious practice, colonial administration, and human agency in early modern Portuguese society.

These records are particularly significant because they demonstrate that even within the constraints of slavery, individuals sought and obtained ecclesiastical recognition for their marital relationships, suggesting complex social and legal frameworks that extended beyond simple master-slave relationships.
