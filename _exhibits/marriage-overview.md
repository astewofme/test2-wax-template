## Portuguese Slave Marriage Records: An Overview

This exhibit provides an introduction to the collection of slave marriage records from 17th century Portugal, preserved in the Torre do Tombo National Archive.

### Historical Context

During the 17th century, Portugal maintained extensive colonial territories and slave trading networks. The ecclesiastical records in this collection document the legal recognition of marriages among enslaved individuals, revealing the complex intersection of religious authority, colonial administration, and human agency.

### Collection Structure

The records are organized into two main collection groups:

- **PT-TT-CEL-002-544-1**: Contains 6 pages of marriage records
- **PT-TT-CEL-002-544-5**: Contains 9 pages of marriage records

Each collection represents different fragments of ecclesiastical documentation from the same period, providing a comprehensive view of the marriage practices and legal frameworks of the time.

### Research Significance

These documents are crucial for understanding:

1. **Legal Status**: How ecclesiastical law intersected with colonial administration
2. **Social Dynamics**: The recognition of family structures among enslaved populations
3. **Bureaucratic Practices**: The systematic recording of personal information in colonial contexts
4. **Historical Handwriting**: The evolution of Portuguese script and documentation practices

### Document Features

The manuscripts exhibit several characteristic features:

- Formal ecclesiastical language and structure
- Systematic recording of names, origins, and marital status
- Evidence of careful archival preservation
- Multiple hands indicating collaborative record-keeping
